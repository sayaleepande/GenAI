            "Climate change refers to significant changes in global temperatures and weather patterns over time. While climate change is a natural phenomenon, scientific evidence shows that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, are accelerating these changes. This increase in greenhouse gases (GHGs), especially carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), traps heat in the atmosphere, leading to global warming, which is a key aspect of climate change.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has reported that the Earth's average surface temperature has risen about 1.2 degrees Celsius since the late 19th century. This rise is primarily driven by increased CO2 levels, which have climbed from about 280 parts per million (ppm) pre-industrial levels to over 410 ppm today.\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Important Developments and Achievements:**\n",

While climate change is a natural phenomenon, scientific evidence shows that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, are accelerating these changes. This increase in greenhouse gases (GHGs), especially carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), traps heat in the atmosphere, leading to global warming, which is a key aspect of climate change.\\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has reported that the Earth's average surface temperature has risen about 1.2 degrees Celsius since the late 19th century. This rise is primarily driven by increased CO2 levels, which have climbed from about 280 parts per million (ppm) pre-industrial levels to over 410 ppm today.\\n\\n**2.
